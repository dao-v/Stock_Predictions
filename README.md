# Stock_Predictions
Using machine learning, I successfully created machine learning models that are able to predict the movement/direction of stock prices.

This project uses Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Gradient Boosting--the results suggest that Random Forest is the best option out of the three machine learning models.

However, since the project is not completed due to personal issues, this repository is meant to serve as a subtitue and summary of the project. One of the scripts is uploaded as the first step I took in this project. The PDF powerpoint presentation outlines the general steps and outcomes of the project
